<p align="center"><strong>A way of encryption through the programming of keys.</strong></p>

# About
KEE is a joke turned real project. Originally I wanted to have my own cypher system (simelar to a ceaser cypher) for some of my friends, but then I moved onto cyphering on a binary level, and it became more of an encryption system. After a bit of back and forth messaging, I decided to actually make an encryption system and language.

It works by writing whatever you feel like is complicated in XKEE (the more you write the better), then compiling it into the KEE format. With this key you can then start by encrypting some files, like images, documents, or plain text files. You can then decrypt those files with the same key.

> [!WARNING]
> I believe XKEE is the first of it's kind, a language specifically for writing ways to encrypt something. Please let me know if this has been done before, I would be very interested to hear about more of these!

# Installation

> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently looking for a way to turn this into an executable. This MIGHT require a rewrite in another language, like Rust. That way it also won't require to install Python 3 and the libraries used.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find it more convenient, make sure to add Python, `kee.py` and `xkee.py` to path. I'm thinking about making an installation script to do this automatically.
